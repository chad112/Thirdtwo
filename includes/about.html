<h1 class="text-center"> About Third Wave Coffee</h1>
<hr>
<div class="about-container">
<p> This coffee shop started with a frustration of coffee not being taken as seriously as it should be. Coffee is a bridge of social experience and incredible taste. The name is representative of a movement from coffee being a commodity to an art, and to a life style. Jimmy is opening up Third Wave Coffee in Fall 2015.</p>
