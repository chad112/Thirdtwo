<h2> Introduction </h2>
<h3> My First Post</h3>

<p>Hi, I am Jimmy Thomas, I am the owner of Third Wave Coffee and I would like to share a small glimpse of my vision for the shop. This blog is going to be used mainly to help educate those of you who are interested in learning more about coffee and also will be used to update everyone on the shop in the coming months leading up to the shop's opening. </p>
	<h4>Coffee is more than just a hot drink that wakes you up in the morning.</h4>
<p>Coffee brings other cultures to our table and allows us to bridge the gap between our world and the world of farmers thousands of miles away. Each origin of coffee brings different exciting flavors to the cup and gives us a chance to stop for a moment and get a glimpse of the hard work put into the coffee for it to get to us. </p>
<p>This is where a lot of the idea and dream started for me. Bridges are already in place connecting us here with the world around us, so I wondered how can coffee be used to impact the world? First by using coffee bought at direct or fair trade prices and standards we can make sure that the farmers are being paid well and can take care of their families. Secondly by traveling to the countries to source coffee to roast for the shop, we can use the shop as a platform for missions and spread the gospel to farmers all over the world (I will be looking to start doing these sourcing/missions trips after the first year). This opens the door to several countries and each cup will be connected to farmers around the globe. Finally by offering several kinds of organic coffee and other organic items in store, we can ensure that we are being responsible with the planet and also we can make sure we know exactly what is going into our bodies. </p>
<p>All of this comes together with my passion for coffee and years of preparation for this opportunity to take coffee further and truly offer something that is above the norm and has to be experienced. Specialty coffee roasted fresh in shop each week with a focus on the world and how to reach it. Be prepared, get excited, and tell your friends!</p>
